You're good to go!

Explanation
-----------

Check out my article on this program [here](http://cdawson.net/blog/2013/08/28/with-apologies-to-english-teachers-everywhere/). All the explanation and background you could ever want.

Don't care about the explanation and just want to run it?
---------------------------------------------------------

The default paramenters rankCutoff and desiredLength (explained in the *explanation*, COUGH COUGH) should be good, so just run that bad boy. Watch the console for your new piece of literary history!
